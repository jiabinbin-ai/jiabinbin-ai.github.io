I am an associate professor at the [College of Electrical and Information Engineering](https://dianqi.lut.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University of Technology](https://www.lut.edu.cn/), China. I have been working here since 2013 after graduating from the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), where I received my Master's degree. From September 2017 to March 2022, I studied at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), and received my Doctoral degree. I received my Bachelor's degree in electronic information science and technology at the [Department of Electronic and Communication Engineering](https://dece.ncepu.edu.cn/), [North China Electric Power University](https://net.ncepu.edu.cn/), in 2010.
